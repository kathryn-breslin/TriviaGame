# Tour de France Trivia 
#### An fun game to test your Tour de France knowledge

## About
Tour de France Trivia is a timed quiz built dynamically with jQuery. 

When the user clicks the 'Start Game' button, the game and the time begin. The user has thirty (30) seconds to respond to five (5) questions. 

The user's guesses are recorded against the correct answers. If the answers are correct, the 'Correct' score increases, similarly for the incorrect guesses and its associated score.

Once the user has completed the trivia, or the time has reached zero (0), the user's score is shared.

This app uses **jQuery**, **HTML** and **CSS** for the dynamic build/logic and front-end architecture.
